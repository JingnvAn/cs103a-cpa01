### Motivation 
Data Science is one of the fastest growing areas in Computer Science and indeed in the world workforce. The ability to find and analyze large datasets is becoming an important component of many jobs and is in general an important skill for informed citizens. The goal of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to use the pandas package to load and analyze a large interesting dataset of your choosing.

### What to do
1. create a git repository called cs103a-cpa01 with a README.md file and clone it to your computer, make sure to add a .gitignore file which should have .DS_Store in it, at least.

2. find a large dataset online (say at least 10,000 data items) and copy it into your repository (if it is too large, e.g. gigabytes, then add it to the .gitignore so it won't go into your repository)

3. create a jupyter notebook called cpa01.ipynb which will hold your work
    create a header cell in which you: 
    
        describe the dataset
        
        give the URL of where to find the dataset and explain how to download it
        
        give at least two interesting questions you have about the data 

    load the data into a pandas dataframe 
    
    use pd.describe() to get a rough overview of the data
    
    analyze your data using the following features:

        print the array of columns and the index array

        create some simple plot of part of the data

        create a pivot table and plot some data from that pivot table use the groupby feature

    create a discussion cell in which you discuss what your analysis tells you about the data

4. push your changes to github
